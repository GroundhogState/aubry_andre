%%  BCS_TO_NONLOCAL    Converts a constraint description of a binary constraint system (BCS) game to a general non-local game description
%   This function has one required input argument:
%     C: A cell, each of whose elements is a constraint in the BCS. The
%        constraints themselves are specified as 2-by-2-by-2-by-... binary
%        arrays, where the (i,j,k,...)-entry is 1 if and only if setting
%        v1=i, v2=j, v3=k, ... satisfies that constraint.
%
%   [P,V] = BCS_TO_NONLOCAL(C) is the general non-local game description of
%   the BCS game described by the constraints C. That is, P and V can be
%   used as the input to functions like NonlocalGameValue.
