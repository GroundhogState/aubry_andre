%%  INDUCEDSCHATTENNORM    Computes a lower bound of the induced Schatten p->q norm of a superoperator
%   This function has two required arguments:
%     Phi: a superoperator, specified as either a Choi matrix or a cell
%          array of Kraus operators
%     P: a real number >= 1 or Inf
%
%   NRM = InducedSchattenNorm(PHI,P) is a lower bound of the induced
%   Schatten P-norm of the superoperator PHI. This estimate of the norm is
%   computed via a randomized algorithm, and thus running this function
%   multiple times may produce different lower bounds.
%
%   This function has four optional input arguments:
%     Q: a real number >= 1 or Inf (by default, Q = P)
%     DIM: a 1-by-2 vector containing the input and output dimensions of
%          PHI, in that order (not required if the input and output
%          dimensions are equal, or if PHI is specified as a cell array)
%     TOL: numerical tolerance used to determine when the algorithm stops
%          running (default sqrt(eps))
%     X0: a vector that acts as a starting point for the randomized
%         algorithm (default is randomly-generated)
%
%   This function has one optional output argument:
%     X: the best input matrix that was found (i.e., the matrix that
%        maximizes the Q-Schatten norm of Phi(X) subject to the
%        constraint SchattenNorm(X,P) = 1.
%   
%   [NRM,X] = InducedSchattenNorm(PHI,P,Q,DIM,TOL,V0) is a lower bound of
%   the induced Schatten P->Q-norm of the superoperator PHI. This estimate
%   of the norm is computed via a randomized algorithm, and thus running
%   this function multiple times (with different X0) may produce different
%   lower bounds. Smaller values of TOL give better numerical precision,
%   but increase the running time of the algorithm.
